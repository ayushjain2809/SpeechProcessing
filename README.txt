The program calculates Cepstral Coefficients for first 
five recordings of each vowel, which are in turn used
to calculate the Tokhura distance for the remaining five 
recordings for each.
	For each of the test file, average distance with 
every vowel is reported, along with the vovel with the 
minimum distance. If the hence obtained vowel is not the 
same as the expected, it is marked with "//Incorrrect".
